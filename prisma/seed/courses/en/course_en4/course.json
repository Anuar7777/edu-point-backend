A lot of tourists came to that particular area, and so with English, they would be able to communicate not only with suppliers, you know things that they need for restaurant's food and so forth, but also with their customers, and so I taught them English and cooking at the same time.\nWoman: Wow. That's, that's pretty impressive. That's interesting. [ ... and tasty. ] Oh, I bet. So, why did you return to the United States? How long have you been back?\nMan: I've been back for, uh, probably about a year now.\nWoman: Okay, so what brought you back then?\nMan: Well, one of my former students opened a sushi restaurant, uh, in town, and he asked me to work with him.\nWoman: Really? What's the name of the restaurant?\nMan: Well, it's called Flying Sushi. Have you ever heard of it?\nWoman: Yes, I've been there. Their food is fabulous; it's top-notch. It's really hard just to get a reservation there.\nMan: I know, and uh, well, I work there two weeknights, and uh, and then ...\nWoman: So, two nights a week you're working there still?\nMan: Right, right, but then, but ... I want to return to teaching. I've also been working as a therapist at a treatment center for teenagers struggling with depression and other mental health disorders.\nWoman: Oh, wow, that would be a really interesting job.\nMan: It is, it is.\nWoman: Wow. You have such a wide range of experience. Uh, you know, to be honest, we have fifteen people who are applying for this position. You've got quite a background, but why don't you tell me three reasons why you would be the best person for this job.\nMan: Um, well, first of all, uh, I understand that different students have different learning styles, and for that reason, I have used iPads, video, music, cooking, drama, role plays, and games to reach every student. [ That's good. ] And second, I have a background in academic and psychological counseling and advising [ Uh, huh ] ... skills that are often needed, you know, in working with international students.\nWoman: Yeah, that could be really useful.\nMan: Yeah, so you know, many of them struggle with, uh, emotional turmoil, you know, home sickness ....\nWoman: Yeah, coming to a new place ...\nMan: Right, so making the transition can be very overwhelming, and uh ...\nWoman: Good. So, what would you say would be a third reason?\nMan: And finally, I speak four different languages ....\nWoman: Four? Wow! What languages do you speak?\nMan: Well, I speak Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese at an advanced level. [ At an advanced level? Wow. ] And I also speak Arabic at a high-intermediate level.\nWoman: That's very, very impressive. You do have an impressive resume.\nMan: Thank you.\nWoman: Uh, what we're doing ... we're going to have two rounds of interviews, and we will contact you on Friday and let you know whether or not you'll be coming back for the second round of interviews.\nMan: Okay.\nWoman: It's been really nice meeting you, and thank you for your time.\n{a}",

That means the cost of living will probably be very high.\nF: It's a higher salary than the job in Frankfurt but lower than the one in Hamburg. The Hamburg job has the most responsibility. From the point of view of career progression that would probably be the best job for me.\nF: Hamburg's the closest to Britain, too, so it would be easy to come back for long weekends and holidays.\nM: That's right, and there's a regular ferry service which would save quite a bit on fares.\nF: What about the cost of living in Germany as a whole? How does it compare with Britain?\nM: Well, it's definitely higher than over here, but salaries are substantially higher, so we'd certainly be better off than we are now.\nF: And what about accommodation?\nM: Well, actually, flats are much cheaper to rent in towns like Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg than they are here in London, so we'd be able to afford to live in a nice, spacious flat, I'd think.\nF: Mmm, that'd be nice! And do you know what the cultural facilities are like in these cities?\nM: In fact, they're quite good in all three. But, of course, Munich has an international reputation as a cultural center.\nF: Another thing we'll have to consider, of course, are the educational possibilities.

I think working overseas will be good for my career and, of course, it'd be a good experience for you and the kids, too!\nF: So we'd be there long enough to enable John to complete a university course.\nM: Well, yes we would, unless of course he preferred to go to a university in the UK. But, yes, if he did want to go to university in Germany, there'd be no problem as each of those cities have their own universities. Munich, in fact, has the second largest university in Germany.\nF: Well, it seems to me the choice must be between Hamburg and Munch. Hamburg has the advantage of being the closest to Britain, so coming home would be relatively easy and inexpensive. Munich, on the other hand, sounds like the most interesting place from a cultural point of view.\nM: I agree with you. Personally, I favor Munich because it's so near to the Alps. We all like sliding and we could go skiing at weekends in the winter.\nF: I think you're right. I had thought Hamburg might be preferable because it's the closest to Britain. But we'll only be abroad for five years, and if we're going to be away, let's choose the most attractive place we can.\nM: Right. That's agreed. Now all I have to do is get the job!\n{a}",

Munich, in fact, has the second largest university in Germany.\nF: Well, it seems to me the choice must be between Hamburg and Munch. Hamburg has the advantage of being the closest to Britain, so coming home would be relatively easy and inexpensive. Munich, on the other hand, sounds like the most interesting place from a cultural point of view.\nM: I agree with you. Personally, I favor Munich because it's so near to the Alps. We all like sliding and we could go skiing at weekends in the winter.\nF: I think you're right. I had thought Hamburg might be preferable because it's the closest to Britain.

Well, I've got the details about different jobs and I'd like your opinion about which would be the best one to go for.\nF: Where are the jobs?\nM: One's in Munich, one's in Frankfurt and the other one's in Hamburg.\nF: Munich's supposed to be a very nice place.\nM: Yes it is, and it's also in a beautiful part of Germany, not far from the Alias.\nF: That would be great for the kids--they'd love to be able to go skiing at weekends!\nM: But, one problem with Munich is that it's growing very fast. That means the cost of living will probably be very high.\nF: It's a higher salary than the job in Frankfurt but lower than the one in Hamburg. The Hamburg job has the most responsibility. From the point of view of career progression that would probably be the best job for me.\nF: Hamburg's the closest to Britain, too, so it would be easy to come back for long weekends and holidays.\nM: That's right, and there's a regular ferry service which would save quite a bit on fares.\nF: What about the cost of living in Germany as a whole? How does it compare with Britain?\nM: Well, it's definitely higher than over here, but salaries are substantially higher, so we'd certainly be better off than we are now.\nF: And what about accommodation?\nM: Well, actually, flats are much cheaper to rent in towns like Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg than they are here in London, so we'd be able to afford to live in a nice, spacious flat, I'd think.\nF: Mmm, that'd be nice! And do you know what the cultural facilities are like in these cities?\nM: In fact, they're quite good in all three.

Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory?\nW: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet.\nM: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease?\nW: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease.\nM: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot?\nW: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories.\nM: Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories?\nW: Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label. And I just picture that bottle to myself.\n{a}",

Harrogate became a fashionable resort during Victorian times, when people came to take a bath in the mineral waters. Today, few people come to visit the town for its mineral waters. Instead, Harrogate has become a popular town for people to retire to. Its clean air, attractive parks, and the absence of any industry, make this an ideal spot for people looking for a quiet life. Now, to tell us more about Harrogate, I have with me Tom Percival, President of the Chamber of Commerce. Tom, one of the things visitor notices about Harrogate is the large area of open park land right down into the middle of the town. Can you tell us more about it?\nM: Yes, certainly. The area is called the Stray.\nW: Why the Stray?\nM: It's called that because in the old days, people let their cattle stray on the area, which was common land.\nW: Oh, I see.\nM: Then, we've changes in farming and in land ownership. The Stray became part of the land owned by Harrogate.\nW: And is it protected?\nM: Oh, yes, indeed. As a special law, no one can build anything on the stray. It's protected forever.\nW: So it will always be park land?\nM: That's right. As you can see, some of the Stray is used for sports fields.\nW: I believe it looks lovely in the spring.\nM: Yes, it does. There're spring flowers on the old trees, and people visit the town just to see the flowers.\n{a}",

Now, tell us something about your after-work activities.\nM: I guess not much different from everyone else. I'm interested in sport, and I run about 3 miles every day. I particularly enjoy cross-country running, where you have to run across fields, jump over streams and so on. While I'm running I think about all sorts of things, and at the end of a run I'm sometimes surprised to find that I've managed to solve a problem that was on my mind. Next year I'm going to try the London Marathon. It's a long, hard race - 26 miles, or 42 kilometres - and you have to be tough to finish, but I very much want to do it. I worry a bit about getting old and I'd like to prove to myself that I'm still almost as fit as I was twenty years ago. I'm interested in climbing as well as running. I'll never become an expert climber, but I know what I'm doing in the mountains. I successfully completed a course in snow and ice climbing when I was younger, and I've done a series of easy climbs in the Alps during the last few years. My wife doesn't share my interest in mountains. She agreed to go climbing with me once, but she found that she felt ill as soon as she got above 1000 metres, so we decide to follow different hobbies.\nW: You certainly seem to enjoy various types of recreation.

It seems to me that some of the spellings are different.\nM: Such as?\nW: Words like theater and center end in \"re\" in England instead of \"er\" like we spell them.\nM: Can you think of any more examples?\nW: The word \"color\" is another case in point. In fact, many words which end in \"or\" in American English are spelled \"our\" in British English.\nM: I'm still not convinced. I mean, if someone comes here from England, we can all understand what he's saying. The spelling doesn't really matter that much.\nW: We're not just talking about spelling. There are differences in pronunciation and meaning too. I remember seeing an English movie where the actors kept calling their apartment a flat.

Only I hope it doesn't snow.\nM: Well, I'll plan on dropping her off at your place on the way to work, around eleven.

You eat all the apples that fall in your yard and you've never complained about that before.\nW: Well, it's easier to pick up apples then to drag tree branches all the way to the curb.

We've always gotten along fairly well, but I think you're out of line here. The branches are your responsibility.\nM: Sorry Jane, I disagree! You take the benefits of the apple tree, but refuse to deal with the bad side of it! Besides, it won't take you any time to get the branches out front!\nW: Get the branches off my property or I'll have to sue you.\nM: Yeah? For what?! You're taking those law classes too seriously! I've gotta go, I have to pick up my son.\nW: You'll be hearing from me.\nM: Yeah, yeah. See you in court Jane.\n{a}",
