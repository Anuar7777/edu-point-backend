Here's a job advertisement. \"Start a new life with Exco Exports Ltd. as personal assistant to our managing director!\" Perhaps it's the job you want.\nW: Personal assistant to the managing director? Yes, it is! Eric, would you like to read it for me?\nM: It's my pleasure! Now, listen--\"We will give the right person £ 3,500 pa for a 45-hour week, free training, the chance to join a pension scheme, 3 weeks' holiday per year and a company car! Canteen facilities are also available.\"\nW: It sounds not so good. Only £ 3,500 every year. I think the salary is fairly low. The working hours seem too long, you see, a 45-hour week. Oh, my dear! And the holidays are short too, only 3 weeks.\nM: But you're interested in this type of job. Since you have no job now, you can treat it as one of your choices.\nW: Hm, you are right. OK, I'll write down the address. Eric, please repeat it to me.\nM: \"Box 4032, London\".\nW: Good, the company's in London. I don't want to work out of this city.\nM: Look, there is another point maybe you will be attracted by.\nW: Yes. Ah, just now, auntie Jenny called me.\nM: Really? What did she say?\nW: She told me there's a job opening for a secretarial position in her company. She asked me to apply for it.\nM: Sounds good. Would you like to try?\nW: I am interested in the work, but you know, her company is in the city of Edinburgh. So I thanked her and wrote down the address only.\nM: How kind she is!\nW: Yes, she is very kind... Oh, she invited us to her villa to attend her birthday party this Saturday.\nM: Sure we are going to attend it. But what present should we take? How about a bottle of wine, or...\nW: Eric! Look, here's another job advertisement.\nM: What is it?\nW: Listen: \"Join one of the world's fastest growing companies: Exco Imports Lid.\"\nM: How about the work?\nW: (go on) \"We are looking for a personal assistant to help our managing director.\"\nM: Another personal assistant to the managing director.\nW: \"We can offer: £ 6,500 pa, 6 weeks' holiday, and a 35-hour week! And we have a supersocial club, too! Interested?\" Yes! I am interested!\nM: Where is the company?\nW: \"Ring Carrie Jones on 01 734 6387 Now? It's in London. Oh, Eric, I am so happy. It's the right job I want.\nM: It seems everything is wonderful.\nW: That's right. I'll call the person now! (dialling sound) Good morning! Is that Ms Carrie Jones? I am Sally Brown...\n{a}",
