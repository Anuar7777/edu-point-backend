It seems to have had a beneficial effect as well.\nW: Really? But were crop losses great?\nM: Yes, However, since the weather following the eruption was unexpectedly good, some crop yields remained steady or even increased beyond normal expectancy levels.\nW: I'm glad to hear that. But what was the beneficial effect you mentioned?\nM: A mass destruction of various insect populations.\nW: How could the ash kill insects without effecting people too?\nM: It's highly abrasive and quickly wears away the outer wax layer, protecting insects bodies. Removal of that layer causes the insects to lose body moisture by evaporation, the result is usually lethal.\nW: How about that? Sounds like an effective yet natural insecticide.\n{a}",
