I also would like to go to Northwestern University, but none of my friends from high school are going there.\nW: You'll make new friends when you go to college.\nM: I'm worried about making new friends. Also, I'm worried that I won't be smart enough to get good grades at a difficult college. I could go to the University of California, but I don't think they have a good teaching school. Most importantly, I want to go to a school that is famous for teaching.\nW: Those are all excellent schools, James. If you're accepted into all those schools, you should consider yourself very fortunate. When I went to school, I went to a very small college, and I still got a great job as principal. You will be successful because you work very hard.\nM: Thanks for your help, Principal Skinner.\n{a}",

Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products.\nW: Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye.\nM: Yeah, it's a really sad day for America.\nW: But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right?\nM: Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago.\nW: Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens?\nM: The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.\n{a}",

You will not be the first to be homesick, find college life stressful, or decisions problematic. So please don't hesitate to come and have a chat if there is anything bothering you. This is a confidential service but we are willing to arrange with your course directors, your tutors, Student Union officers, career department or doctors. We can also put you in touch with outside counselling services. As a part of the university, all counselling is free of charge for full-time students. I know some of you may feel that seeing a counsellor has a stigma attached to it, but let me assure you even the best balanced individuals encounter situations where they need someone to talk with.
