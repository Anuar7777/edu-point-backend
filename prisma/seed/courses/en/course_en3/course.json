How's your little boy, has he started school yet?\nRoss: Oh, yes, he's in the second year now.\nFisher: What, already? Doesn't time fly! Is he enjoying it?\nRoss: Very much, it's much more fun than being home!\nFisher: Haha. Well, I suppose we'd better make a start. Shall we get down to business?\nRoss: Right. First of all can I confirm the time and date of the presentation? It's Saturday 24 October in the morning.

They might think that's overdoing it. They'll want to get back to their families, as it's Saturday.\nRoss: All right, the normal pre-lunch snack buffet will be what you need--that's basically the same as what you had last February.\nFisher: Oh, that'll be fine.\nRoss: OK, well, we'll charge for the room, coffee and snack buffet at the standard rate less 15%, as we agreed. And we'll charge for the drinks served on a pro-rata basis.\nFisher: Free, fine, yes.\nRoss: What type of... um.., equipment, furniture would you like?\nFisher: Well, let's have.., um... four.., no, no... five tables for our display. Er... we'll bring our own stands. Now, there's an overhead projector and sound system already in the room, I believe? Can you get someone to check that before we come, you know, to see that it's working?\nRoss: Oh, of course, the technician will be with you when you're setting everything up.

You've got a problem.\nMark: I mean, is there anything I can do to revive them?\nSusan: Not unless you're a magician.\nMark: Well, can you recommend a quick-growing variety that can take its place?\nSusan: Marc. I'm sorry. You've made a mistake ... A big mistake.\nMark: ... except that my wife warned me this could happen ... Oh, man.\nSusan: Oh, shoot. Listen. You made a blunder. A big mistake. A really big mistake. But unless your wife goes on vacation for a couple of years, you're not going to be able to replace the roses that fast.\nMark: So, any recommendation? I mean, what do I do?\nSusan: You need to talk to her.\nMark: Are you kidding? You don't know my wife.\nSusan: I'm sorry. Look. You've waited long enough. Don't let the grass grow around your feet. Say something, but be sure to hide the garden shears before you do. Kneel down; ask for forgiveness now.\nMark: But that's what I did when I killed her prized apple tree last year.\nSusan: No way. Really?\nMark: Oh, man. Oh! She's coming in from outside [Oh, no, oh no.].\nSusan: One final word: Hide the weed killer. [But ...] Thanks, Mark. That's all the time we have for now. Let's move on to the next caller.\n{a}",

So, are you doing some last-minute shopping before the weekend?\nTim: Well, actually, I'm looking for supplies to put together 72-hour kits for each member of my family.\nLisa: [A] 72-hour kit? What's that?\nTim: Basically, a 72-hour kit contains emergency supplies you would need to sustain yourself for three days in case of an emergency, like an earthquake.\nLisa: An earthquake?! We haven't had an earthquake in years.\nTim: Well, you never know; you have to be prepared. Hey, if earthquakes don't get you, it could be a flood, hurricane, snowstorm, power outage, fire, alien attack. [Alien attack!] Well, you never know. Think of any situation in which you might find yourself without the basic necessities of life, including shelter, food, and water, for over a period of time.\nLisa: Hum. So, what do you keep in a 42-hour, um, ... I mean 72-kit?\nTim: Well, you should have enough food and water to last you three days, and you might want to pack a basic water filter or water purification tablets in case your only water source turns out to be a murky pool of bug-infested water. [Ugh!] Hey, sometimes you don't have a choice, and as for food, you should keep it simple: food that requires no preparation and that doesn't spoil. And no canned goods because they are often too heavy and bulky. [Okay, that makes sense.] And unless you have a can opener or the can has a pull-tab lid, you'll have to use a rock or something to open them. [Ah, instant mashed green beens.] Yeah, and oh, energy bars, beef jerky, and a mix of nuts, raisins, and chocolate are possibilities.\nLisa: Huh, the food might be nasty, but I guess you could survive ... barely.\nTim: Well, the food doesn't have to taste bad; just select things that are easy to prepare, and you might want to include some basic comfort foods like a couple of candy bars. Then, you have to decide on the type of shelter you might need.\nLisa: A hotel sounds nice.\nTim: Yeah, but that's really not an option. The reality is that you might have to evacuate to a shelter, possibly with hundreds or thousands of other people.\nLisa: That doesn't sound very fun ... everyone packed together like sardines in a can. Unsanitary conditions. Disease.\nTim: Ah, now you're sounding paranoid, but if a shelter isn't available, you might be completely on your own, so I always pack an emergency sleeping bag or small, lightweight tent in the event that I have to survive on the street or in a park.\nLisa: Wow.\nTim: And among other things, you should pack a flashlight, portable radio, extra batteries, a small first-aid kit, personal items like a toothbrush or toothpaste ... Having a change of clothing is also important.\nLisa: What about money? I have a credit card.\nTim: Right. Like that's going to help when the power is out. You'd better be prepared with coins and cash, and having small bills is a must.\nLisa: So, what do you do to communicate with other family members in case you get separated?\nTim: Oh, in that case? I always pack two-way radios to communicate with the group. You can never depend on cell phones. [Okay.] Plus, you should decide on a meeting point in case your family gets separated.\nLisa: Well, that sounds like a detailed plan, definitely.\nTim: Oh, that's not all. You never know what weather conditions you might encounter, so packing a rain poncho, a jacket, and something to start a fire with could be very useful.\nLisa: Like Matches?\nTim: Matches? (If) You drop those in a puddle of water, you're toast. You need to pack at least three forms of fire starter: a magnifying glass, a high-quality lighter, and waterproof matches.\nLisa: Wow. I never thought about those either. So, what do you do if you have small kids? They'd probably go stir-crazy under such conditions.\nTim: You're exactly right, so a little extra preparation for them is needed. If you have to evacuate to a shelter to wait out a disaster, kids soon will be bored out of their minds, so you have to pack small card games, paper, or something like pencils or crayons to draw with.\nLisa: You know, preparing a 72-hour kit makes perfect sense ...\nTim: Yeah, but most people thinking about it after it is too late.\n{a}",

(If) You drop those in a puddle of water, you're toast. You need to pack at least three forms of fire starter: a magnifying glass, a high-quality lighter, and waterproof matches.\nLisa: Wow. I never thought about those either. So, what do you do if you have small kids? They'd probably go stir-crazy under such conditions.\nTim: You're exactly right, so a little extra preparation for them is needed. If you have to evacuate to a shelter to wait out a disaster, kids soon will be bored out of their minds, so you have to pack small card games, paper, or something like pencils or crayons to draw with.\nLisa: You know, preparing a 72-hour kit makes perfect sense ...\nTim: Yeah, but most people thinking about it after it is too late.\n{a}",
          "text_kz": "Lisa: Hi, Tim. So, are you doing some last-minute shopping before the weekend?\nTim: Well, actually, I'm looking for supplies to put together 72-hour kits for each member of my family.\nLisa: [A] 72-hour kit? What's that?\nTim: Basically, a 72-hour kit contains emergency supplies you would need to sustain yourself for three days in case of an emergency, like an earthquake.\nLisa: An earthquake?! We haven't had an earthquake in years.\nTim: Well, you never know; you have to be prepared. Hey, if earthquakes don't get you, it could be a flood, hurricane, snowstorm, power outage, fire, alien attack. [Alien attack!] Well, you never know. Think of any situation in which you might find yourself without the basic necessities of life, including shelter, food, and water, for over a period of time.\nLisa: Hum. So, what do you keep in a 42-hour, um, ... I mean 72-kit?\nTim: Well, you should have enough food and water to last you three days, and you might want to pack a basic water filter or water purification tablets in case your only water source turns out to be a murky pool of bug-infested water. [Ugh!] Hey, sometimes you don't have a choice, and as for food, you should keep it simple: food that requires no preparation and that doesn't spoil. And no canned goods because they are often too heavy and bulky. [Okay, that makes sense.] And unless you have a can opener or the can has a pull-tab lid, you'll have to use a rock or something to open them. [Ah, instant mashed green beens.] Yeah, and oh, energy bars, beef jerky, and a mix of nuts, raisins, and chocolate are possibilities.\nLisa: Huh, the food might be nasty, but I guess you could survive ... barely.\nTim: Well, the food doesn't have to taste bad; just select things that are easy to prepare, and you might want to include some basic comfort foods like a couple of candy bars. Then, you have to decide on the type of shelter you might need.\nLisa: A hotel sounds nice.\nTim: Yeah, but that's really not an option. The reality is that you might have to evacuate to a shelter, possibly with hundreds or thousands of other people.\nLisa: That doesn't sound very fun ... everyone packed together like sardines in a can. Unsanitary conditions. Disease.\nTim: Ah, now you're sounding paranoid, but if a shelter isn't available, you might be completely on your own, so I always pack an emergency sleeping bag or small, lightweight tent in the event that I have to survive on the street or in a park.\nLisa: Wow.\nTim: And among other things, you should pack a flashlight, portable radio, extra batteries, a small first-aid kit, personal items like a toothbrush or toothpaste ... Having a change of clothing is also important.\nLisa: What about money? I have a credit card.\nTim: Right. Like that's going to help when the power is out. You'd better be prepared with coins and cash, and having small bills is a must.\nLisa: So, what do you do to communicate with other family members in case you get separated?\nTim: Oh, in that case? I always pack two-way radios to communicate with the group. You can never depend on cell phones. [Okay.] Plus, you should decide on a meeting point in case your family gets separated.\nLisa: Well, that sounds like a detailed plan, definitely.\nTim: Oh, that's not all. You never know what weather conditions you might encounter, so packing a rain poncho, a jacket, and something to start a fire with could be very useful.\nLisa: Like Matches?\nTim: Matches?

Can I go see the nine O'clock showing?\nFather: The five o'clock showing!\nDaughter: How about the seven o'clock showing?\nFather: And why are you so concerned about the show time?\nDaughter: Well, I don't know if I'll get all of my chores and homework done before then.\nFather: Sorry, but I want you to get to bed early that night, and so, I can drop you off at the movie theater about 4:30 so you'll have time to get tickets.\nDaughter: Uh, Dad. Can I have money for the movie?\nFather: Sure, just go into the family bank vault behind secret mirror in the hall and take a few hundred. [Dad!]. Look. I can only spare a few dollars, so you'll have to come up with the rest, okay?\nDaughter: Okay. Thanks, Dad.\n{a}",

If you are suffering from anxiety or depression, poetry may be the solution to your problems. Dr Stewart, how does poetry help?\nM: Em, OK! Look, let me give you an example. A patient came into our clinic last month. He was a middle-aged businessmen, and he was feeling, well, like most middle-aged businessmen, really stressed and with his life out of control. He talked to me about it, and, well, I was convinced that medication just wouldn't help him. Then I read him a poem called Leisure by WHDavis. Do you know the one? It begins, er...\nW: I do, yes.\nM: What is this life, er, so full of. It is so or if...\nW: I think it's if.\nM: If full of care, that's it, yes. We have no time to stand and stare. Well, you know the one. The next time he came to see me, he told me that, well, it was a sort of turning point for him. The poem made him think about the quality of his life and the need to find a balance between his work and his social life. Er, you see, because the idea was expressed poetically, he felt that he could identify with it, and actually feel the message in a way that he wouldn't if he simply discussed it with me. And we just had the usual kind of conversation about it.\nW: Yes, I see.\nM: You see, reading poetry to patients seems to make them calmer. Encouraging them to write it has an even more dramatic effect, actually. Era, there.., there are something about the process of expressing confused thoughts and feelings and emotions in writing that actually helps people or suffering from stress and anxiety. This happens especially if the words are written in a poetical way with a sense of rhythm rather than in prose, you see. Er, now, for a long time, we've been asking patients to write diaries to put their feelings into words. But it turns out that writing poetry seems to work much better for many patients.\nW: Right, and have you found that other doctors and therapists have made the same discoveries?\nM: Yes, many of my colleagues have successfully used poetry with patients suffering from anxiety or depression or even eating disorders. I mean their patients said that, that reading poetry made them feel less stressed. You know, almost as many said that writing it has the same effect. You see, some said that writing poetry reduced the pain they felt when a friend or a close relation had died extraordinarily!\nW: Yes, it certainly is!\nM: Era. Others thought that it enabled them to reduce or stop taking antidepressants or tranquillizers. And writing poetry helps them to provide a sort of outlet for their emotions.\nW: Em, that's fascinating! Can you give any explanation as to why poetry might be calming in this way?\nM: Well, it's only a guess. But I say that the calming effect of poetry is related to an interplay between the left and right hemispheres of the brain, the.., you probably know the left half is the one which analyzes and responds to language while the right one visualizes images and responds to rhythm. Now, I believe that poetry may activate the system at the base of the brain where thoughts meet emotions, you see.\nW: Do you think that people need a doctor to prescribe particular poems for particular conditions?\nM: No, no, no. I think poetry can help everyone to feel calm and less stressed. People who read poetry tend not to be anxious and stressed, probably because they are in touch with their emotions. I mean they certainly don't need a doctor to tell them which poems to read.\nW: Thank you very much, Dr Stewart.\nM: You are welcome.\n{a}",

I saw large piles of garbage cans at the roadside, and graffiti all over garage doors and store shutters.\nFrank: I can't believe it.\nTerry: The garbage are tidily bagged and boxed, though.\nFrank: Did you stay in a hotel?\nTerry: Yes. The hotel we stayed at turned out to be fairly decent, though the room was small, with a tiny bathroom that was only about 3 feet larger than the bed. As I was inexperienced with tourist-area hotels, I was startled, I mean, the room was $129 a night. But at least the room was clean and the bed reasonably comfortable.\nFrank: What's your general impression of New York?\nTerry: Well, restaurants pack their tiny tables very tightly; grocery stores and bookstores have aisles that are narrow; the sidewalks are cluttered with newsstands, vendors and their carts, and places that aren't restrictively small, such as the lawns around the Natural History Museum, are full of people, so they're no escape.\n{a}",
