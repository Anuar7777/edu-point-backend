As far as I know, you are a very successful teacher, and quite popular among the students, so I want to ask you some questions about your teaching and your students.\nM: OK.\nW: First question, do you often give homework to your students after class?\nM: It depends. Maybe once or twice a week.\nW: Do you think it is good for your students to do a lot of homework?\nM: No, I don't think so. Too much homework takes too much of their free time. I seldom give homework to my students on the weekend.\nW: Do you agree the students need a lot of exercises in their spare time?\nM: Well, yes, but they also need time to relax and have a rest, especially on weekends.\nW: You are a great teacher. By the way, what do you do in your free time?\nM: I'm a very good football player. My team won the first place in our city last year.\nW: Congratulations! Well, thank you for your help.\n{a}",
