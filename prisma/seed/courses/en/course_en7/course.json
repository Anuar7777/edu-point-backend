The part-time web designer was not as good as what we had thought before. She informed us just now that she could not complete this task.\nW: Well, didn't you talk with her about what she should do at the beginning?\nM: Not really. She was recommended by Sampson and from what he told me, she sounded to be pretty qualified to do the job. I'm not asking for a terrific web design but to build up a structure with all the basic elements of web design.\nW: Did you ask her why she wasn't frank with you in the beginning if she couldn't do the BBS?\nM: I did. But she said it was a communication problem.\nW: So now what do you plan to do since she got the job half done?\nM: On one side, I will not pay her full fees since she wasn't honest with me in the beginning. On the other side, I have to search around for another guy to complete the job.\nW: I agree. That should also teach her a lesson. For us, I think we had better turn to our Part-time Job Center for help. There, we can get a professional to work at it.\n{a}",

I was responsible for overseeing about 30 employees. I did all of the ordering for the store, and I kept track of the inventory.\nM: What was the most difficult part of your job?\nW: Probably handling angry customers. We didn't have them very often, but when we did, I needed to make sure they were well taken care of. After all, the customer is always right.\nM: That's how we feel here too. How long did you work there?\nW: I was there for three and a half years. I left the company last month.\nM: And why did you leave?\nW: My husband has been transferred to Boston. And I understand your company has an opening there too.\nM: Yes, that's right. We do. But the position won't start until early next month. Would that be a problem for you?\nW: No, not at all. My husband's new job doesn't begin for a few weeks. So we thought we would spend some time driving to Boston and stop to see my parents.\nM: That sounds nice.

I've been to many countries such as Britain, Italy and Sweden. So I spend a lot of time at airports. While waiting for my flights, I watch people passing by and start my imagination. For example, the other day, when I was waiting for my flight to Greece, I saw a couple. They were buying magazines at that moment. They were not wearing business clothes, but the man was carrying a suitcase. Every few seconds, the woman looked around. I wondered if someone was following them. Perhaps they were running away, and you know, this reminded me of a story in the newspaper that day: a bank clerk stole one million pounds a week before and disappeared with his wife. There was a picture of them in the paper. The couple really looked like the wiz. Maybe I should stop them. Just then, I saw them say goodbye to each other, and the woman walked away. Well, sometimes I make mistakes like that. But I find things like that are very useful for my writing.\n{a}",
