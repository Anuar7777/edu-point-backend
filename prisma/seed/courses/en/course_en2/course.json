It is important not to hide anything from yourself or anybody else.\nCrystal: What advice would you give teens?\nVet: Take things slow, and be a kid as long as you possibly can. Don't expect everything to be perfect, and make decisions for yourself. Live life to the fullest. Love yourself first, and everything else will fall into place.\n{a}",

Are we ready, Ashley? [Ready to eat.] No, let's wait for a few minutes. We'll get to that. But as you know, my faithful listeners, I starting cooking and baking almost 30 years ago when my grandmother taught me in her humble kitchen. In fact, she taught almost me everything I know, and I've never attended cooking classes [You should have ...] Wait, wait, wait ... I know my daughter's going to mention to you faithful listeners that recently as I was helping the kids prepare for our kitchen for chicken meal, I forgot to take the chicken out of the oven, burned the bird to a crisp, and we ended up ordering pizza for dinner.\nKids: We had to use the fire extinguisher.\nChef Randall: But that's another story. So, anyway, today I'd like to share with you our favorite ... at least my favorite ... chocolate chip cookie recipe. Now, before you switch the TV channel, I know what you are thinking. \"Another fattening cookie recipe.\" But wait. What makes this recipe great is that it offers a wonderful low-fat, low-calorie, low-cholesterol dessert for the entire family.\nKids: We still like the fat though.\nChef Randall: Well, I know we do. But let's see. We have all the ingredients, so we can start by mixing all of the ingredients, the sugars, the flour, the egg whites, the low-fat butter, vanilla, baking soda, and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. Then, we add the mini chocolate chips. Now, my kids would like me to add the big ones but we start with the mini-chocolate chips. And don't forget to preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit). And finally, when the cookies are done, take them out of the oven, remove them from the cookie sheet, and let them cool before their fingers get into them. Did I forget anything?\nKids: Yeah, if you have college-age kids, be sure to make a few extra batches they can take back to school for their roommates. And don't forget the kids still at home.\nChef Randall: Oh, well yeah. We can't do that. We can't forget them. And unfortunately, by the time your kids get the cookies, you, the cook, will be left with a single cookie - your instant diet plan for you - and a dirty kitchen. So, that's all for today. On next week's show, we will be showing you how to feed hungry teenagers on a budget without having to sell the family car. Until then.\n{a}",

You're in hot water now.\nHenry: If it had only been that.\nSam: Oh, there's more?\nHenry: Yeah, you see, the water from the vase spilled all over the manuscript of a book my wife has been writing for the past two years. It blurred the ink over many of the pages. [Oh no.] And so one of the guys had the bright idea of drying the pages by the fire while we watched, uh, the rest game, but a spark from the fire must have blown out and burned the manuscript to a crisp.\nSam: But what about an electronic file copy? Had one, didn't she?\nHenry: Well, actually, her computer crashed the day before while I was playing some computer games, and I haven't been able to get it to work since.\nSam: Man, are you in trouble now. [I know.] You're going to have a hard time digging yourself out of this one. [Yeah.] Ah, so I get it now.

So, Alex, how can we save the environment?\nAlex: By saving water.\nInterviewer: Well, how can we do that?\nAlex: By not using too much water when we wash dishes, take a bath, and when we do other things, like watering the plants outside.\nInterviewer: Oh, I think I can do that. What else?\nAlex: When drinking or eating something outside, you should keep the garbage until you find a trashcan to put it in because littering makes our planet dirty. Do you like seeing trash all over the ground?\nInterviewer: No, I don't. Do you have any final suggestions?\nAlex: Yes. We shouldn't waste paper because trees are being cut down to make the paper. By recycling paper, we save the forests where animals live.\nInterviewer: So, how can children recycle paper, I mean, everyday?\nAlex: Well, for example, when I was in kindergarten, I used to save the newspapers so that I could make things make out of them, like paper trees, instead of just throwing them away. Now, the children in our neighborhood collect newspapers once a month to take them to a recycling center.\nInterviewer: That's great. Well thanks Alex for your ideas.\n{a}",

What kind of unusual ability are we talking about here?\nW: Wow, it's quite easy to describe. Basically, when I read a word or even think of a particular word, such as Tuesday, I see a color connected with it. It's not that I imagine a color. I really see it loading in front of my eyes.\nM: How interesting! Is it a sort of medical condition?\nW: Yes. And just recently doctors have begun to understand it more. They call it synesthesia, which means that somewhere in my brain, there are links between sections that should really be separate. Other people have a form of this condition that affects emotions. So they see colors when they feel particular emotions. Apparently, it's generally passed on from parents to their children, which is the case with me.\nM: Do you have any brothers or sisters with the same ability?\nW: Yes, my brother is the same as me. If we start talking about it, people think we are completely mad. When we were younger, we used to have arguments about things like what color the word Tuesday is. It turns out that everyone with this condition sees different colors.\nM: It sounds as though it could make life quite exhausting.\nW: I suppose it does. But you see, if you've never known anything different, you don't think of it like that. It does make you aware of your moods. I know when I started to feel depressed, things begin to look grey.\nM: Are there any other advantages do you find?\nW: Well, it seems that quite a lot of artists and musicians have this condition. So I guess it can be beneficial if it's combined with some sort of gift or natural talent, which is not the case with me unfortunately. But I do find that it makes reading very interesting, because sometimes a sentence has a very nice range of colors. So you want to read it again just to experience that.

[ Oh good! ] I'm on the Wafu Diet.\nAndrew's Sister: What? I've never even heard of the Wafu Diet. What is that?\nAndrew: Ah, it's too difficult to explain. I found information about it in my junk mail the other day ...\nAndrew's Sister: What? You read your junk mail? No one reads their junk mail.\nAndrew: ... and I signed up for it, and it only cost $490.\nAndrew's Sister: You're serious? [ Yeah. ] Four hundred and ninety bucks? [ Yeah. ] Like every month or every week or ...?\nAndrew: I didn't check that ... ah, ah, but, but, but, but ... I think ...\nAndrew's Sister: Listen. I think you're getting scammed, and it sounds really stupid, so listen. I'm not fat anymore, so trust me. I ... if you want to lose weight, you need to do it the right way.\nAndrew: Well, like what?\nAndrew's Sister: Well, okay.\nAndrew: Okay, uh, well, look. Look at my running shoes over there.\nAndrew's Sister: Andrew. They're still in the box. ( Well ... ). Never used. Besides exercise, yeah, exercise is wonderful. It's great, but you also need to learn how to eat right. For example, you need to eat smaller portions. And, and you can't load up your plate with seconds and thirds like you always used to do at the family parties.\nAndrew: Well, okay. I'll just get a bigger plate!\nAndrew's Sister: Andrew! That won't help. Next [ Oh, next? ]. Oh yeah. So, first of all, smaller portions [ Okay. ] Then, you need to make sure you eat a good, well-balanced breakfast first thing in the morning [ I do that. ] and then you follow that up with smaller meals throughout the day, cause, you know what? If you skip breakfast, then throughout the day, you feel like you need to make up it by overeating at lunch and dinner and lots of snacks. [ Uh ... ]\nAndrew's Sister: Anyway, um, oh yeah. Don't eat late at night. [ What? Like what? ] Well, you know a lot of people ... they want a ... they want a late night snake and stuff like that, but a lot of times, that's really, really high-calorie stuff like ice cream and things, and your body's not active to burn it off, so you just store all those calories as fat. You have to throw away ... Oh my gosh! [ What? ] That's all you have in your freezer! You've only got ice cream in here! You're going to have to throw that all away?\nAndrew: It's low-calorie (ice cream).\nAndrew's Sister: Low cal. No, it's not low-cal. Look right here. Andrew! That's all the food you've got in here is ice cream.\nAndrew: Well, what else, what else?\nAndrew's Sister: Also, what else are you eating? [ Well, you know ...] I mean, seriously. All you eat is ice cream? Oh, oh, oh. Look in your trash. You go to McDonalds every day. Every day you're eating at fast food? [ Well ...] Okay, you got to cut out the fast food. When you know the manger of McDonalds by name, and he's your best buddy on Facebook, you know that you're going to McDonalds or any fast food place too much.\nAndrew: Uh, this is going to be tough.\nAndrew's Sister: Yeah. It probably will be. But you also need to eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables [ Oh, well. ]; cut way back on sugar. No more sugary drinks like those five gallons of Coke you drink every day.\nAndrew: I don't drink five gallons.\nAndrew's Sister: Close enough. Look at the size of those cups! How many times do you refill them?\nAndrew: Well, then, drink what?\nAndrew's Sister: Water! [ Water? ] It's really good for you.\nAndrew: Oh, this is going to be tough.\nAndrew's Sister: It might be.\n{a}",

And if we could start with some personal background information.\nB: Sure.\nA: Right, if I could just have your age...\nB: 35.\nA: Right, great. And your job?\nB: Systems analyst, but for the form I don't know whether it would count as professional or business or what.\nA: What do you think?\nB: OK, it's more like business.\nA: Fine. And would you mind my asking about your salary? Or we can leave it blank.\nB: No, I don't mind. It's 40,000 a year.\nA: Thank you. Right... about your current watching habits..., what would you say is your main reason for watching TV?\nB: Well, at work I tend to read for information and what have you, so I'd say that with TV it probably just helps me relax and unwind.\nA: Fine. And how many hours a day on average do you watch TV?\nB: Not a lot really... I should say just over an hour.\nA: So what are the two main times of the day that you watch TV?\nB: Well, a little around breakfast time and then it tends to be really late eleven or even midnight- when I've finished work.\nA: And what sort of programmes do you go for?\nB: Some news bulletins but I also really like to put my feet up with some of the old comedy shows.\nA: Fine.

And, if I need a filling, can I get one that looks like my other teeth?\nDentist: If we can save the tooth with a filling, I recommend a high-strength silver alloy filling instead of a porcelain one.

Whereas here, I think that they- er-the kids get to know about how different countries are run at a much younger level and they know all about the United States and how it's run.\nInterviewer: What do you think the reasons are for that?\nMathew: Urn-that's a good question-urn-well, I think that the reasons are-just because of the Press. You hear so much about America here that people are-they're into it-they want to know what it's about and how it's run. And so many of our policies in America affect Britain that they want to understand how policies are made and all that and seeing that that doesn't work on the other level like Britain's policies don't-I mean, they can affect us, but not to as great an extent and therefore you don't hear as much about Britain and people don't know as much about it.\n{a}",

How much money do you spend on your apartment?\nRon: Uh, I pay $890 on rent for the studio apartment downtown ... not including utilities and cable TV. But the place has an awesome view of the city.\nNancy: Uh, $890! Why are you paying through the nose for such a small place when you could find a cheaper one somewhere outside of the downtown area?\nRon: Yeah, I guess.\nNancy: Okay. How much money do you spend on food a month?\nRon: Hmmm. I'm not really sure. I think I spend around $600. [$600?!] Well, I go out to eat at least four times a week, so those expenses add up. I just don't enjoy eating alone, and I don't have a knack for cooking like you do.\nNancy: Well, I can understand that, but perhaps you ought to buy some microwaveable meals you could prepare at home.\nRon: Well, I guess I could.\nNancy: And entertainment?\nRon: Well, I spend a few dollars here and there on basketball and movie tickets, a concert or two, and ballroom dance lessons.\nNancy: Uh, exactly how much do you spend on all of these? Just a \"few\" dollars?\nRon: Well, oh ... about $400 or so.\nNancy: Or so? No wonder you're having money problems. You can't just blow your money on things like that! And what about transportation?\nRon: Oh, I commute to work everyday in my new sports car, but I got a great deal, and my monthly payments are only $450. Come outside and take a look. We can go for a spin!\nNancy: No, I've heard enough. You've got to curb your spending, or you'll end up broke. I suggest you get rid of your credit cards, cut back on your entertainment expenses, and sell your car. Take public transportation from now on.\nRon: Sell my car?! I can't date without a car. What am I going to say? \"Uh, could you meet me downtown at the bus stop at 7:00?\" Come on!\nNancy: And you need to create a budget for yourself and stick to it, and start with paying off your bills, starting with me. You owe me $50 dollars.\nRon: Fifty dollars! Wait, I only borrowed $20 from you last week. How did you come up with $50?\nNancy: Financial consulting fees. My advice is at least worth $30!\n{a}",

To be honest, I'm really in the hole, and I can't seem to make ends meet these days.\nNancy: What do you mean?
