The course he gave on town planning last year, it was just the same-a load of details, which you could have got from a book anyway. There was no overall ...\nM: No general overview you mean?\nW: Yes. I suppose you could call it that. I couldn't see the town for the buildings.\nM: But you've got to have the details in this kind of subject. Anyway I think he's good. You take his first lecture for instance. I thought that was very interesting, and not at all over-detailed.\nW: Well, he starts off all right, but then he just piles on the details.\nM: Now you're exaggerating.\nW: Well, the way he dealt with the Western developments, that wasn't bad, I suppose.\nM: You seem to have got something. Perhaps Potter is a little disorganized, but I think he's good.\nW: Do you really think so?\nM: He does do most of his teaching to the postgraduates. He only does the one undergraduate course each year. After all, I think he tends to forget where he is. He starts off being nice and general and then tries to cram in a bit too much specialized information.\nW: The main thing I object to is the lack of direction.\n{a}",

You can find this name on the reading list. Doctor Seuss is his pen name.\nM: I love reading those stories as a child. It'll be interesting to read them now from a different point of view. I guess they'll give me a good idea of how children think.\nW: Those stories are also great for classroom use.\nM: How's that?\nW: Well, take a typical Doctor Seuss's book like The Cat in the Hat. It has a controlled vocabulary of only two hundred words.\nM: So that means the children get lots of practices using a small number of words over and over again.\nW: Exactly. In fact The Cat in the Hat was written mainly to show how a controlled-vocabulary book could also be interesting and fun.\nM: Well, it sounds as though this course is also going to be interesting and fun. I think I'll get started on those readings tonight.\n{a}",

Mostly when people say that they never dream, what they really mean is that they don't remember their dreams or they don't think their dreams are important. The reason behind is that they might have been made fun of with a child when they first reported their dreams or it was so frightening that they just turned off dreaming completely. The other day, someone named Davis came to me and said that he used to be a great dreamer, but suddenly he stopped having dreams. I asked him what it happened. It turned out that his brother died by heart attack and he never expected that such a terrible thing would happen to a young person. Generally, when there was some frightening event and dream about it was too terrible. People prefer not to dream about it. Actually the worst thing you can do is stop dreaming. Because it means that the bad experience would be too painful to even appear in dreams. As long as you dream about it and even the dream is frightening, your mind is working on it. My personal opinion about what dreams do is that they help us deal with our problems. We see certain patterns take place in dreams. When a person is hurt deep inside, when a person is seriously ill or when a person has been really sad, if people turn off their dreams totally, it means they don't love themselves to even think about it.\n{a}",

Look at this!\nM: What? Are you getting interested in nineteenth-century plays all of a sudden?\nW: No. Look at the signature. Someone gave this book as a present, and wrote a note on the inside of the front cover. It's dated 1856. Maybe it's worth something.\nM: Everything on that shelf is worth fifty cents.\nW: But if this is the signature of someone who is well-known, it might bring a lot more. I hear William Shakespeare's signature is worth about a million dollars.\nM: Oh? I can hardly read what the one says. Who wrote it?\nW: The name looks like \"Harold Dickinson\". Wasn't he a politician or something? I'm going to buy this book and see if I can find a name like that in the library.\nM: Good luck. Your book of plays may make you rich, but I'll bet my seventy-five cents novel is a better buy.\n{a}",

We require that the family lies live within a reasonable distance of the school, have enough living space for the student, and live in a clean, safe and comfortable area. We also work with families who enjoy having international students. We try to match each student with a family as best we can.\nM: If I stay with a home-stay family, what should I expect?\nW: The family will treat you as a guest, and you will be expected to obey house rules. All families provide a single or shared room and a choice of meals. In most cases, students will be expected to share the bathroom. Experiences has shown us that living with a family is the most interesting and effective way to learn the language. Remember, your home-stay family will have different customs and habits from what perhaps you are used to. Meals will be prepared by the family. All home-stay families are within 30 minutes, travelling time of the school. The smaller the city, the less time it takes to reach the school.\n{a}",

You live in Florence, how long have you been living there?\nW: Since 1982. But when I went there in 1982, I planned to stay for only 6 months.\nM: Why did you change your mind?\nW: Well, I'm a designer. I design leather goods, mainly shoes, and handbags. Soon after I arrived in Florence, I got a job with one of Italy's top fashion houses, Ferregamo. So, I decided to stay.\nM: How lucky! Do you still work for Ferregamo?\nW: No, I've been a freelance designer for quite a long time now. Since 1988, in fact.\nM: So, does that mean you design for several different companies now?\nW: Yes, that's right. I've designed many fashion items for a number of Italian companies, and during the last four years, I've also been designing for the British company, Burberry's.\nM: What have you been designing for them?\nW: Mostly handbags, and small leather goods.\nM: Has the fashion industry in Italy changed since 1982?\nW: Oh, yes. It has become a lot more competitive. Because of quality of products from other countries has improved a lot. But the Italian quality and design is still world-famous.\nM: And do you ever think of returning to live in England?\nW: No, not really. Working in Italy is more interesting. I also love the Mediterranean sun and the Italian life style.\nM: Well, thank you for talking to us, Susan.\nW: It was a pleasure.\n{a}",
