And I'm not average. I have driving down to an art, so we should be able to cruise through traffic and get there in less than fifteen minutes.\nPassenger: Okay.

It's half past four. [Thanks] Uh, this IS your first time to the city, right?\nPassenger: Yeah. How did you know?\nDriver: Well, you can tell tourists from a mile away in this city because they walk down the street looking straight up at the skyscrapers.\nPassenger: Was it that obvious?\nDriver: Well ...\nPassenger: Oh, before I forget, can you recommend any good restaurants downtown that offer meals at a reasonable price?\nDriver: Umm ... Well, the Mexican restaurant, La Fajita, is fantastic. [Oh] It's not as inexpensive as other places I know, but the decor is very authentic, [Okay] and the portions are larger than most places I've been to.\nPassenger: Sounds great! How do I get there from the museum?\nDriver: Well, you can catch the subway right outside the museum. There are buses that run that way, but you would have to transfer a couple of times.

What's, what's the problem?\nMan: Well, for about six months, he's been really down, and sometimes, I can't get him out of bed in the morning to go to school. He just seems so depressed. I just can't figure it out.\nWoman: So, this has been going on like half a year?\nMan: Yeah, kind of on and off, but I don't know. I ... I just thought it would just kind of go away, and I just thought things would just get, I don't know, get better.\nWoman: Yeah, that's not, that's pretty worrrisome. Um, I mean, I've noticed he's not hanging out with Jared very much anymore. You know, is he ... what's he doing when he's up?\nMan: Well, uh, a lot of the time he's not up. He just kind of uh, stays in bed. [ Really? ] I just can't figure it out. I don't know.\nWoman: Yeah, that's, that's a big problem. I can see why you're really worried about him. Have you considered taken him to see a therapist, or a psychologist, or anybody?\nMan: Ah, no. I, I ... It's probably just a phase or something. I think some kids were picking on him at school, but I think that's stopped. He doesn't talk about it anymore, so I guess that's over.\nWoman: So, you're saying that he was like being bullied and stuff?\nMan: Yes, yeah. But he didn't talk about it a lot. I thought it was just, you know, having some problems, and it just kind of would go away.\nWoman: Well, you know, I don't know about that with the bullying or whatever, but you know, this has been going on for a long time. You really need to seriously address it.\nMan: I don't know. Uh, and well, his girlfriend just broke up with him, so I guess maybe that's had an impact on him.\nWoman: Yeah, it has. Uh, that explains a lot. Um, have you looked at his Facebook page lately? [ What? ] He posted some stuff, well, he was posting some stuff, I think it was last night around midnight, um, yeah, talking about how much life sucks, wishing he could just disappear. [ Oh! ] Um, you know, I can't remember exactly the words he said, but I know that it really, really worried me. Some of the things he wrote are signs of, they might be thinking about suicide.\nMan: Ah, I, I, I just can't figure that out. I mean, kids sometimes just talk like that. I, I, I thought. I thought that was kind of natural.\nWoman: Yes, sometimes they do that. That's what makes it hard. Sometimes, kids just talk like that, but some of them are serious, and some of them end up talking their own lives. Some of them really do kill themselves. You know, you need to take this seriously. Six months (of being depressed) isn't normal. Six months isn't just to act like this isn't just a phase. It's, there's something going on.\nMan: So, any ideas? I mean, what should I do?

[ Yeah ... ] You could take him down to the hospital, down to the emergency room, so ...\nMan: I don't know.\nWoman: You know, it's really important because you've got to get on top of it. He needs you; he needs to know that you really love him, that you're not just kind of ignoring this.\nMan: You know, I recently noticed that that I just saw some marks on his arms the other day, and I didn't know.

I don't know how well he knew the boy, but uh, I don't know.\nWoman: Yeah, things like that do have an impact on kids, and you just can't run the risk.

You'll scare the deer away. They have a great sense of hearing and smell, so we have to remain out of sight.\nPaul: Well, as you know, I really don't eat much meat ...\nDan: You don't have to eat it. I'll take care of that. Just get ready. As soon as the sun comes up in a few minutes, you can often see the deer down in that meadow. You see that stream down there. [Yeah. ]We just need to quietly get a little closer.\nPaul: Uh, Dan. How about if I just wait here and watch, you know, watch our stuff?\nDan: No, man. We'll have a better chance at bagging a deer if we're together.\nPaul: Uh, man, I forgot my ammo back at the truck. What a bummer! I guess I'll just have to sit here and watch.\nDan: Are you crazy? Here. Take these shells and load your rifle. Taken 'em. Take 'em.\nPaul: Uh. [cough, cough, cough ..] Hey deer. If you're out there, run!\nDan: What are you doing? Cut it out! There's a huge deer now. Ah, he's mine! Watch this!\nPaul: Run, Bambi.\nDan: [Bang, bang, bang.] What did you do that for?\nPaul: Yes, [looking confused ...] Why are you reloading? They're gone.\nDan: Stand around here for much longer, and you'll see. Any last words?\n{a}",

You arrive by taxi or bus or whatever here, on the right, can you see? That's the bus terminal. And you go in through the main entrance. You could go to Water World first but I think you'd better miss that out as you're short of time, you said. You see the cable cars? Well, those long lines are the wires and the little circles are the cars going up and down to the next level. Well, walk past the cable car terminal, at the bottom of the plan, and bear right past the Waterfall Gardens. Actually, have a look in, there are ducks and other birds in the pool there-it's very pretty. Then you'll see some steps up on the left. Follow that path and you'll come to the Centenary Garden which is a good place to stop and take pictures if you've got your camera. Then carry on until you're almost at the Children's Zoo. Right. I wouldn't bother to visit the zoo if I were you, it takes quite a long time to walk round. But I do recommend the \"Touch and Feed\" section opposite, as I said. It's great fun for small children.\nB: Ok, so we'll pay a visit there, and then what?\nA: You could come back a different way past the Chinese rock garden. Oh, that's lovely-do wander around if there's time. Then go down the steps to the Otter Pool-you can have a sit down there for a little while and watch the otters messing around in the water. Then back to the cable car terminal where you can catch a car to the upper level. The journey takes about ten minutes, I suppose, it's quite a long way. Now if you look at the other plan, the one for the upper level, you'll see where you arrive.\nB: Is this the terminal here in the bottom left hand comer?\nA: Yes, that's right. The fun fair is in the top left hand corner. Can you see? With \"The Dragon\" I was telling you about, and \"The Octopus\" and \"The Spider\". Do you think you'll want to go to that?\nB: Um, well, I think the children are a bit too young really, but they might enjoy watching other people.\nA: OK. Well, if you're feeling quite hungry by the time you arrive, which you probably will be, why not have a snack in the Chinese Restaurant next to the terminal?

After that, walk up to \"The Dragon\" and watch people being really scared! Then you could come down to the Ocean Theater, which is just to the left of the center of the plan- and see a performance of dolphins or maybe the killer whale. You'll have to check the times for that. There's one at two o'clock, I think. I'm not sure about the high diving, but you may be able to see that as well. If there's time, you could also carry on to the fight and have a look at Wave Cove. And finally, if you're not too exhausted by then you could return to the lower level by using the famous escalator.

I'm calling for a friend who is interested in attending a US university.\nReceptionist: And that's the kind of, uh, instruction that we provide, from basic communication courses to content-based classes such as computer literacy, intercultural communication, and business English.\nCaller: Great. What are your application deadlines for the next semester?\nReceptionist: Well, we ask applicants to apply no later than two months before the semester begins. [Uh-hum] This gives us time to process the application and issue the student's I-20.\nCaller: An I-20?\nReceptionist: Oh, an I-20 is a form that indicates that we are giving permission for the student to study in our program, and then the student takes this form to the US embassy in his or her country to apply for the F-1 student visa.\nCaller: Alright. What is the tuition for a full-time student?\nReceptionist: It's two thousand thirty dollars.\nCaller: And how does one apply?\nReceptionist: Well, we can send you an application and you can mail it back to us, or you can fill out our application that's online at our Web site.\nCaller: And are there other materials I would need to send in addition to the application form?\nReceptionist: Uh, yes.

Vet, what was life like for you as a child?\nVet: Life was fun. I was always very loved, even without my father around. I was somewhat of a troublemaker, but I have a lot of good memories to show for it. Being a child was the best time of my life.\nCrystal: How have your childhood years affected who you are today?\nVet: I was raised by very strong, supportive people. My mother and sisters have a lot to do with who I am. I also learned many lessons, good and bad, which have made me a strong adult. They have helped me realize what I need to do to be happy. My mother has always been the best person in my life. She has never let me down, and has always been very supportive. Whenever I needed a friend, she was one. My sisters have also been there for me. When my morn was getting her college degree, she would be out late, and my sisters stepped in and played morn. They are my best friends and give me great advice.\nCrystal: What have been some of your biggest trials, and how have you overcome them?\nVet: The biggest trial in my life was when I got pregnant sophomore year. It was a new road to travel. I didn't have to get over it, I had to accept it and learn to adapt. Another trial would be trying to get over the love of my life, my baby's father. We were engaged, but things went the other way. I had to learn to love myself more than I loved a man.\nCrystal: Who helped you during your pregnancy?\nVet: My morn and sisters were everything I needed them to be-a mother, sister, boyfriend, best friend and father. All my friends were there for me, I could cry to them whenever I needed to. I'm especially thankful for my morn. It was hard for her to deal with two pregnant children at the same time. The dad and his family were also there, which was a blessing\nCrystal: When a bad situation comes up, what do you do?\nVet: I try to find the best way to deal with it. I am often faced with issues in my school about my race. It is not easy to keep your temper, but you have to try to understand why people are upset and angry. I try to find a way out without hurting anyone, or. myself.\nCrystal: How has being so small and pregnant affected your body?\nVet: It has worn me out. My body is stretched in places I never knew I had. My hips are huge, I won't be a model again anytime soon. Being pregnant so young has emotionally drained me. I have so many things to worry about now, and my emotions are like a roller coaster. One minute I am happy, and the next depressed. I never spend time on my appearance. I'm always focusing on my baby.\n{a}",
